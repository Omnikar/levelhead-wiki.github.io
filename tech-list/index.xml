Rebound Rebound Super Jump With GR-18â€™s back against a wall, perform a Super Jump. At the peak of the Super Jump, throw the package upwards again. Immediately rebound blast twice. Grab and jump off the package as GR-18 passes up through it. Without a wall, a more precise timing of rebound blast in one direction and then the other can be used.</description></item><item><title>Just the Robot and the Goods</title><link>https://levelhead.wiki/tech-list/you-and-the-goods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://levelhead.wiki/tech-list/you-and-the-goods/</guid><description>GR-18 Sprint Jump While GR-18 is sprinting, jumps gain one extra tile of height. This allows GR-18 to reach a total of 5 tiles high and 15 tiles across.
Wall Sprint (AKA Wall Wailing) While running against a wall, GR-18 does not lose sprint. This techinque can be used to maintain sprint while waiting for an obstacle to pass or a door to open.
Sprint Direction Change (AKA Aerial Disco) Normally when GR-18 changes lateral direction, sprint is lost.</description></item></channel></rss>
