### Wiggler Toe Touch Launch

### Stable Drift
Without vertical momentum, enter a series of wigglers about 4 tiles above the wigglers to traverse the wigglers with minimal vertical movement. Entering at the peak of GR-18’s normal jump works for this tech.

## Powered Gate

### Gate Jump
If a door closes on GR-18 and he is inside of the block, but only enough to be pushed out and not crushed, he can perform another jump off of the gate itself. A full jump can be made from the top of the gate, adding **2** tiles to whichever jump you can perform off the gate.

## Spikeatrons

### Pixel Toe _(AKA Ledge Jumping, One-toe Ledging)_
Using the properties of the circular hazard hitbox, it is possible to stand GR-18 on the very edge of a solid block that has a Spiketron above it. This also applies to Spike Traps and Whizblades. This does not apply to 1x scale Cromblers.
