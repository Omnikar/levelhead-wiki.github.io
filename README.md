1. The best way would be to send a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your changes. To do so, create a GitHub account, click on the "Fork" button to make your own personal copy of the website source, make your changes, and then send the Pull Request. One of the website maintainers (currently only CDSLice#0476 on Discord / BookOwl on GitHub) will review your contributions, help you make any edits required, and merge it into this repository so it can be part of the website.

2. You can also create an issue on this repository with your problem reports (typos, grammer errors, broken links, etc.) or suggestions for the website. Although you can make issues that include content you want to add to the site, Pull Requests are the proper format for this and will make the process much easier for everyone involved.

3. Finally, if you can't use GitHub you can join the [Butterscotch Shenanigans Discord](https://discord.gg/GKFCC8U) and then ping **@CDSlice#0476** in a DM with any problem reports or suggestions.
